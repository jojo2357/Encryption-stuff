By encryption, we are just referring to an enigma-style textual encryption where each letter is mapped to another. Included is an encryptor, a decryptor, and two helpful programs.

# List of files: 
* `Decryptor.java`: attempts to break the enryption in `cipherCreated.txt`
* `Encryptor.java`: encrypts data in `startedWith.txt` with a cipher given by the user
* `FrequencyCounter.java`: Counts how many times a character appears in a given file
* `RegexTester`: If you would like to test regex's for guessing, use this!

Very open source! 

I might add an oxford dictionary api to help out in cases where the distribution of the first 4 letters isn't as expected. Thats pretty advanced and I already have a lot going on so maybe not. 

If anyone would like to improve the guessing ability of the computer, please feel free! As well as I did, it still cant solve for a majority of letters and only works on big chunks of text.
